Just imagine you're marking these as you finish them idk

1. [15 marks] Make a new 3D project and Git repository named with assignment number and group
name. Be sure all group members are using Git and making commits in the spirit of collaborative
source control. Add the markers and the instructor with Reporter level permission (GitLab) or
Collaborator (GitHub). //Done By Gabe, Gianna


2. [5 marks] Remove your player movement, camera code, and levels from Assignment #4. //Done By Gianna

3. [30 marks] Add the ability to procedurally generate a level. You may use prefab elements (wall
segments, collectables, enemies, etc.) as puzzle pieces to build the level. Your level should have a
start and end point. Upon reaching the end, the next procedurally generated level should begin.
The player should have the ability to quit at any time and be taken to the completion screen which
shows statistics like levels completed, time taken, etc.

4. [10 marks] Add an overhead camera that follows the player through the level (i.e., as the player
moves, the camera centers on the players x, z position).

5. [10 marks] Create a NavMesh for the current level. Obstacles should be flagged as static.

6. [10 marks] Add a NavAgent script to the player.

7. [10 marks] Add the ability to click on a location and have the NavAgent move the player to that
location (if reachable). If the location contains a collectable, collect it. If the location contains an
enemy, approach and attack (melee).

8. [10 marks] Add features to make your game uniquely yours and awesome.
